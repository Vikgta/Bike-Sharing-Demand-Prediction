# Bike-Sharing-Demand-Prediction


Bike sharing systems represent a method of bicycle rental where membership, rental, and bike return processes are automated through a network of kiosk locations across a city. With these systems, individuals can rent a bike from one location and return it to another as needed. Currently, there are over 500 bike-sharing programs globally.

The data generated by these systems is appealing to researchers because it explicitly records travel duration, departure and arrival locations, and elapsed time. Essentially, bike sharing systems operate as a sensor network, providing valuable insights into mobility patterns within a city. In this competition, participants are tasked with integrating historical usage patterns and weather data to predict the demand for bike rentals in the Capital Bikeshare program located in Washington, D.C.
